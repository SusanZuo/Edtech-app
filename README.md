# CMU Course Comparator

A web-app to compare the relative difficulty of courses at Carnegie Mellon University.

# Basic User Flow

This is what we want to implement.

1. Log in / set up an account.
2. Enter the classes you have taken (course number, teacher, and semester taken).
3. Given two courses at a time, click on the harder course.
4. See the results for your course difficulty ranking and the comparisons across all users.
